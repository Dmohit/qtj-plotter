# qtj-plotter
A java library for Big Data Visualization using Qt graphics
This project should currently be considered in pre-alpha or alpha stage.
Although everything works, and is mostly bug-free, not much is currently implemented.
The code can currently only draw scatterplots.
Features that we wish to add next are ability to draw axes, lines and legends.
